# Sarcastic Unique Number Generator

Welcome to the Sarcastic Unique Number Generator, the revolutionary tool designed to hand you a completely pointless, yet mathematically unique number, served with a healthy dose of snark! If you’ve ever felt the inexplicable urge to generate random numbers while being gently mocked, you’ve come to the right place.

## Features

- **Unique Numbers**: Because who doesn’t want a number that’s as unique as a snowflake? Except, of course, this one is cold, hard, and utterly meaningless.
- **Sarcasm Included**: Every unique number comes paired with a carefully crafted sarcastic remark to remind you just how thrilling this experience really is.
- **Simple and Pointless**: Click a button, get a number. It’s as simple as that. No extra features, because you don’t need them. Or deserve them.

## How It Works

The process couldn’t be easier, even for you:

1. A random number between 1 and 1 trillion (because bigger numbers are obviously better) is generated.
2. The system checks if that number has already been bestowed upon someone else.
3. If it’s unique, congratulations—you’re the proud owner of a shiny, one-of-a-kind number! If it’s not, don’t worry; we’ll keep trying until we find a unique one.
4. Receive your number alongside a sarcastic message carefully curated to keep you humble.

## Sample Sarcastic Messages

Here’s a sneak peek at the kind of loving insults you can expect:

- "Wow, another number. Your life must be thrilling!"
- "You clicked a button. Groundbreaking stuff."
- "Here’s your rare number. We’re totally impressed. Not."
- "Celebrate! You’re now the proud owner of a meaningless integer."
- "This number is yours forever. Aren’t you special?"

With over 30+ snarky comments (and counting), you’ll never feel underappreciated.
